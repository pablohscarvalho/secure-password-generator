# 🔐 Secure Password Generator

> 🏆 **Project 1 of 45** | Python Practice Challenge

A simple and efficient Python script to generate random and secure passwords, allowing the user to define the desired length.

## 📋 About the Project

This project was developed as part of my Python introduction portfolio. I am challenging myself to create a new, simple project every day to solidify the concepts I learn.

The main objective was to create a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that automates the creation of strong passwords using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

## 🚀 Features

- [x] Generates completely random passwords.
- [x] Allows the user to choose the password length.
- [x] Uses a full combination of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) for higher security.
- [x] Input handling (converts text input to numbers).

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **Python 3**
* `random` Library (for randomness logic)
* `string` Library (for character sets)
